26/3/2019 - tried serial communication between arduino and teensy. used a voltage divider to step 5V arduino output down to 2.5V (10k resistor either side of divider), which worked fine with teensy. at 9600(whatever that unit is), was able to send 300 messages per second from arduino and receive them all fine on teensy. at 115200 was able to send >6000 messages per second, which is hopefully plenty. the messages were ~5 bytes each so basically sending/receiving at the proper rate, i.e. can send 115200 bits per second. oh, apparently you can actually go way higher than this, so that's good, because sending 64 lots of 8 10-bit analog values would eat up a lot of data - you could only do it 22 times per second (although maybe that's just about acceptable?). anyway, ought to think of a clever way to compress the data and not send unused channels, but hopefully can just crank the baud rate to something huge regardless.
can also happily send data the other way, just did a direct link between the two, 3.3V output into 5V input worked fine.
