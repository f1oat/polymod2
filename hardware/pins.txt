Arduino pins:
0	read serial from teensy
1	write serial to teensy
2	write address E0
3	write address E1
4	write address E2
5	write address F0
6	write address F1
7	write address F2
8	
9	chip select for address (A to D) shift register
10	chip select for module data (LEDs etc) shift register
11	MOSI to shift registers data in
12	
13	SCK to shift registers SCLK
A0	read analog sensors
A1	read module ID
A2	read patch connections
A3	read/write(?) aux channel
A4	
A5	

NB deliberately grouping ports in this way for fast port manipulation, see https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/PortManipulation

Teensy pins required:
Serial in (from Arduino)
Serial out (to Arduino)
Menu inc button
Menu dec button
Menu confirm button
Menu cancel button
I2C pins x2 (used for audio)
Audio pins x5
SPI pins x3 (used for SD + memory, if either in use)
SD select (if in use)
Memory select (if in use)
Analog CV inputs x2(or more I guess)
OLED select
MIDI input

Teensy 4 has now been released so pinout is confirmed, and it looks like it should work fine. Currently have 2 pins spare, could increase that to 3 or 4 by getting omitting extra RAM (can't be bothered with the fiddly soldering, and Teensy 4.0 should have loads more RAM anyway), and possibly by condensing the menu buttons into 3 pins using a shift register (maybe a good idea anyway - could then add more buttons if needed). Extra pins could be used for a PWM CV/audio output (requires two pins for the version in the official library) or maybe two lower-quality single-pin PWM CV outputs. Teensy 4 has no DAC, hence need for PWM CV outs. Could also add a 3rd/4th CV input if really wanting to max out the pins.
