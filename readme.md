# PolyMod 2

This is (or will be) an open source modular synthesizer, built using digital rather than analogue technology. This approach retains the flexibility of an analogue modular synth (e.g. Eurorack) while being cheaper to build. Other advantages include polyphony, a free open source database of modules to install, and the ability to save and retrieve patches.
