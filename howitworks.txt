Here's how the system will work, as of Aug 28th 2019:

PolyMod 2 will be a synthesizer system that can physically fit in a Eurorack case, be powered by a Eurorack power supply, and have some limited connectivity with Eurorack modules (maybe two audio ins/outs and two CV ins/outs), but for the most part it is electrically incompatible and separate from the Eurorack system.

PM2 will consist of a master module, with various other modules connected to it. The master module will have ports to connect up to 14 modules - more can be added with expander modules.

The modules in the PM2 system will be patchable like Eurorack modules, but will use breadboard jumper wires. The patching is done physically and sends a digital signal to the master module, which updates an onboard soft synth with the patching data.

The master module contains a Teensy 4.0 for audio processing and a Teensy LC to handle the physical interface (patching, knobs, LEDs, etc).

The Teensy LC (currently using an Arduino but will upgrade soon) scans every patch point on every module. There are 8 groups of modules, each containing up to 8 modules, giving a total of 64 (although 2 modules are used up by the master module). It also reads all the knobs and buttons, and writes to any LEDs.

The Teensy LC communicates with the Teensy 4.0 via serial. Possible messages are as follows:

END LOOP (command 0) - signifies the end of one cycle of updates, no other data needed.
PATCH CONNECTION (command 1) - signifies that a patch cable is connected. Contains 6 bytes of data: the group number, module number, and socket number for both ends of the patch cable.
ANALOG READING (command 2)
MODULE ID READING (command 3)
